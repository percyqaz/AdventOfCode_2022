Don't look at any of the solutions if you don't want spoilers!

(Solutions will only appear after the leaderboard is full)

Just an excuse to try out 1 morbillion different programming languages and tools

Here's some languages I plan on using (the more impractical the better):
- Prolog
- ~~Google Sheets~~
- F#
- Something using only actors and concurrency
- Go
- ~~Rust~~
- Haskell
- AutoHotkey
- Bash
- Python
